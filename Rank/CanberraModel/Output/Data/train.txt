2 33 pm day defendant used two bank cards belonging Ms Geissler purchase attempt purchase gift cards Woolworths supermarket post office suburb Hawker ACT The purchase attempted purchase gift cards occurred three separate transactions form basis charge The total value transaction case including administration fees 95 95 4 At hearing defence primary submission evidence establish beyond reasonable doubt defendant user card transactions subject charges I refer identification argument The second arm defence related description charge property said obtained I deal first identification argument 5 I heard evidence voir dire Senior Constable Badman Senior Constable Badman unrelated interaction defendant 9 March 2018 approximately three weeks commission offences defendant charged Following interaction lookout notice circulated within AFP connection offences The lookout notice contained still images captured CCTV footage form part Exhibit P10 Senior Constable Badman identified defendant basis still images The question admissibility opinion evidence Senior Constable Badman effect person shown still images defendant resolved admission photograph took time interaction defendant March 2018 That photograph marked Exhibit P11 6 It contest Exhibit P11 depicts image defendant appeared time March 2018 I able compare image shown CCTV footage still images captured form part lookout notice 7 The CCTV footage clear Despite I conclude person depicted footage relation three transactions person That conclusion part aided seen clothing worn occasion transaction 8 My conclusion upon comparison photograph marked Exhibit P11 person shown CCTV bears strong resemblance image defendant photograph However extent evidence I could conclude beyond reasonable doubt defendant person depicted CCTV footage 9 That evidence however evidence prosecution relies 10 There unchallenged evidence defendant time alleged offences relationship Mr Byron Hancock Mr Hancock gave evidence The still images attached lookout notice included images Mr Hancock taken CCTV footage unlawful transactions using cards also stolen Ms Geissler used vicinity time transactions subject current charges Mr Hancock easily identified still images 11 Mr Hancock charged offences obtaining property deception relating unlawful transactions He pleaded guilty offences sentenced The statement facts pre sentence report tendered sentencing purposes evidence Exhibits P12 P13 respectively The statement facts refers defendant co offender although charged separate offences 12 Mr Hancock says memory committing offences referred statement facts He attributes lack memory use ice time He said know whether defendant time committing offences As I understood testimony Mr Hancock entered pleas guilty charges past could remember occurred occasions either DNA fingerprint evidence admitted resulted found guilty He said influenced plead guilty latest occasion despite said lack memory In addition would course also persuasive evidence CCTV footage still images taken formed part lookout notice 13 The prosecution says acceptance Mr Hancock statement facts sentenced evidence acceptance defendant properly described co accused conduct alleged statement facts correctly described 14 No objection raised admission statement facts pre sentence report The admission evidence requires consideration interaction several sections Evidence Act 2011 ACT including ss 65 83 Some complexities involved use admissions one co accused another subject comments Australian Law Reform Commission Reports 26 102 15 In circumstances however I persuaded ruling admissibility necessary I say two reasons The first unrealistic treat Mr Hancock agreement statement facts sentencing purposes constituting admission contrary interests defendant He defendant charged separate offences Realistically said statement facts separate offending defendant concern Mr Hancock sentencing To infer conduct amounted admission interests defendant circumstances simply drawing long bow 16 The second reason due Mr Hancock said testimony basis upon pleaded guilty He says using methylamphetamine extensively recollection offending There basis question plea guilt circumstances basis attaching weight said statement facts defendant 17 For reasons given I disregard contents statement facts pre sentence report insofar said amount contain admissions contrary interests defendant 18 Certain aspects statement facts however comprise persuasive circumstantial evidence In particular evidence Mr Hancock present place time transactions subject present charges took place b evidence unlawful transactions undertaken Mr Hancock used stolen cards used transactions subject present charges 19 What supplements evidence unchallenged testimony Mr Hancock relationship defendant time offences committed I concluded strong resemblance image defendant shown photograph comprising Exhibit P11 person shown CCTV footage 20 The combined effect evidence satisfies beyond reasonable doubt defendant undertook transactions subject charges Court 21 I turn consider second defence arguments 22 As noted outset reasons defendant charged two counts obtaining property deception one count attempting obtain property deception In case offence charged obtaining amount money 95 95 belonging cardholder Ms Geissler Again noted earlier defendant allegedly used bank cards buy gift cards Woolworths supermarket post office 23 The defence argument whatever might obtained amount 95 95 belonging cardholder I referred several authorities draw distinction notions property chose action They useful present purposes confirm starting point analysis absent considerations ordinary credit card transaction involving acquisition goods services matter legal principle result user card obtaining amount equal cost goods services see R v Hawcroft 2009 ACTSC 145 citing R v Capewell 1995 2 Qd R 64 R v Rigney Hopkins 2005 QCA 275 24 The Code applies offences charged In circumstances application Code renders authorities referred limited utility 25 At outset I comment prosecution submissions framed terms argument particulars charge I accept starting point analysis case particularised charges property alleged deceptively obtained The issue however really one required way evidence satisfy statutory requirements permitting subject charge expressed monetary value

Before moving I set view I take relation inferences available evidence issue receipts 52 Ordinary experience indicates point electronic transaction using card check made I describe validity card used Most people experience card declined There many possible explanations experience including spending limit exceeded card expiry date passed fault card machine used process transaction That experience indicates immediate electronic check enquiry card point use However necessarily follow relevant transfer funds cardholder via intermediary merchant immediate 53 Similarly common knowledge card

elements attempt offence require prosecution prove beyond reasonable doubt defendant attempted deceptively obtain property subject charge The prosecution relied upon deeming provisions 330 establish relevant property amount taken cardholder account virtue attempted transaction 61 Given transaction subject charge 10583 2018 proceed I cannot satisfied beyond reasonable doubt credit entry ever made

1 The defendants face four charges 6B 2 iv Animal Welfare Act 1992 ACT Act failure take reasonable steps provide animal appropriate treatment illness disease injury 2 The charges defendant Each charges relates one four animals time commission alleged offences kept Yarralumla Play Station facility owned operated defendants 3 The charges follows charges CC 41193 41189 2018 relate yellow male

seized RSPCA inspectors 4 April 2018 following complaint days earlier condition animals Yarralumla Play Station Following examination veterinarian determined condition animals option euthanize 5 The Criminal Code 2002 ACT Code applies offences Act identification physical fault elements offence created 6B 2 iv straightforward Section 6B 1 Act imposes broad obligation person charge animal This obligation expressed duty care animal The specific obligations impliedly case virtue 6B 2 straightforward enough The charge defendants case brought sub paragraph iv referring failure take reasonable steps provide treatment illness disease injury 6 I invited prosecution defence make submissions relation physical fault elements I primarily I saw difficulty reconciling apparent requirements application Chapter 2 Code In particular Chapter 2 would require proof failure defendants provide appropriate treatment measured reference understanding rather objective test inherent use expression reasonable steps b proof defendants intended fail take reasonable steps default fault element provided Chapter 2 Code see 22 7 The difficulty reconciling obligations expressed way defendant said intentionally failed something might subjectively recognised requirement 8 The defence written submissions effect element offence defendants obligation act would arise knowledge illness disease injury The case Taylor v Royal Society Prevention Cruelty Animals SA Inc 2016 SASC 61 cited support submission Taylor involved appeal decision magistrate conviction offence committed contrary 13 2 Animal Welfare Act 1985 SA That section imposes implied obligations differently expressed 6B Act although create offence based upon failing take reasonable steps mitigate harm suffered animal The magistrate dealt matter basis necessary prove defendant knew animal suffering That conclusion challenged appeal Of course South Australia equivalent encompassing Code dealing elements criminal responsibility decision therefore persuasive present purposes 9 My analysis elements charged offences follows 10 An offence 6B 2 iv conceptually materially different category offences sub paragraphs iii The implied obligations sub paragraphs provide food water shelter opportunity display normal behaviour obligations matter common sense apply animals times However implied obligation 6B 2 iv logically applies animal suffering illness disease injury perhaps precisely animal requires treatment illness disease injury 11 Whilst identified section terms follows prosecution 6B 2 iv succeed prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt requirement treatment illness disease injury existed In words offence failing take reasonable steps provide appropriate treatment succeed unless established beyond reasonable doubt requirement treatment existed 12 Accepting case requirement would constitute physical element circumstance By virtue chapter 2 Code absence express fault element section default fault element recklessness 13 It follows prosecution succeed relation charge 6B 2 iv necessary evidence establish beyond reasonable doubt merely defendant failed take reasonable steps provide treatment first animal required treatment illness disease injury b defendant knew least reckless requirement existed 14 The deconstruction elements offence 6B 2 iv referred goes way reconciling must proved successful prosecution The need prove defendant intentionally failed take steps provide appropriate treatment sits easily proof defendant knew requirement treatment existed 15 In addition deconstruction also logically accommodates proof requirement treatment based upon recklessness That say proof defendant aware substantial unjustified risk requirement treatment existed logically reconciled requirement also prove defendant intentionally failed take reasonable steps provide appropriate treatment 16 Having reached conclusion elements offence analysis facts dealt quite shortly 17 The defendants knowledge recklessness requirement treatment animals subject charges come result direct observations Mr Perkins reported combination 18 I recognise theory recklessness test may met might described wilful blindness basis upon prosecution case conducted 19 The evidence known Mr Perkins came Ms Taylor Ballard Mr Aaron Jones employees Yarralumla Play Station course Mr Perkins There evidence Mr Perkins made relevant direct observations relevant animals He says relied upon reported Ms Ballard Mr Jones 20 Ms Ballard commenced working Yarralumla Play Station February 2018 In testimony Ms Ballard said employed told duties would involve l ooking farm animals assisting animals care However course employment Ms Ballard given duties duties directed animal welfare made difficult properly carry animal welfare role I accept evidence She presents person cares deeply animal welfare clearly concerned able fulfil role 21 It apparent however despite competing demands time fact carry inspections animals report Mr Perkins There evidence Mr Perkins told reports incomplete inadequate time properly 22 In circumstances I persuaded unreasonable Mr Perkins rely upon reported 23 The evidence relation reports turkey materially different two chickens canary I deal evidence relating latter three birds first 24 Even assuming present purposes evidence established requirement treatment chickens canary evidence specific concerns brought attention Mr Perkins either Ms Ballard Mr Jones indeed anybody else 25 There evidence upon conclude Mr Perkins either knew reckless requirement treatment canary 26 The charges relating bird must therefore dismissed 27 Ms Ballard said made general observations Mr Perkins risk laying chickens becoming egg bound I note testimony Dr Liang difficult lay person identify chicken egg bound In circumstances I accept prosecution submission general observations Ms Ballard sufficient put Mr Perkins notice reckless specific requirement treatment relevant time two chickens subject charges 28 The charges relating two chickens must therefore also dismissed 29 As noted earlier evidence turkey puts different category 30 I deal first question whether evidence establishes turkey need treatment illness disease injury Despite opinions expressed Dr Liang based upon review reports video I prefer testimony Dr Flesser observations Ms Ballard state animal immediately arrival RSPCA officers I find basis testimony turkey need treatment illness disease injury time alleged offence 31 That conclusion leads analysis whether Mr Perkins knew reckless condition turkey Ms Ballard says told Mr Perkins concerns turkey shrugged For part Mr Perkins acknowledges told concerns turkey says told monitored 32 It necessary point deal findings credit 33 Ms Ballard presented forthright young woman I said evidently cares deeply animals She quite new job RSPCA seizure took place I left impression struggled somewhat doubt competing priorities one hand wanting carry work directed employer hand wanting properly fulfil part role dealing animal welfare Against background I think likely least said RSPCA inspectors went beyond reported Mr Perkins 34 Mr Perkins gave evidence defence case He also generally presented forthright witness There however one aspect testimony warrants special mention Mr Perkins cross examined meeting Ms Ballard took place 6 April 2018 The RSPCA seizure taken place 4 April Ms Ballard left premises immediately thereafter 4 April appear heated exchanges She attended meeting 6 April request Mr Perkins He described exit interview In course cross examination Mr Perkins denied meeting asked questions Ms Ballard animals seized RSPCA two days earlier gave rational explanation done In circumstances evidence inherently improbable I believe My conclusion Mr Perkins truthful gave evidence That turns causes doubt aspects evidence 35 On issue reported Ms Ballard Mr Perkins turkey I prefer testimony Ms Ballard I find report concerns turkey I find arrangement monitoring referred put place Mr Perkins response accurately described Ms Ballard said Mr Perkins pretty much brushed I said 36 Having reached conclusion I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt report Ms Ballard Mr Perkins establishes Mr Perkins least reckless need treatment illness disease injury time alleged offence 37 What falls next consideration whether circumstances failure Mr Perkins take reasonable steps provide appropriate treatment 38 The evidence gives rise uncertainty point time report Ms Ballard concerns turkey made Mr Perkins That material consideration constitutes reasonable steps provide appropriate treatment logically temporal qualitative aspect 39 For part Mr Perkins said report turkey took place morning RSPCA inspectors arrived seized turkey 40 For part Ms Ballard could certain spoken Mr Perkins She expressed terms I noticed unwell I brought defendant attention pretty much week RSPCA come seized 41 Later Ms Ballard evidence following exchange took place prosecutor Ms Ballard Was indication defendant medical treatment veterinary treatment would pending relation turkey No Look fair go downhill quickly 42 That evidence leaves open reasonable possibility Ms Ballard report Mr Perkins condition turkey fact made morning RSPCA officers intervened 43 The culpability Mr Perkins conduct must assessed time referred charges time RSPCA intervention 44 There evidence given hearing would appropriate treatment turkey would reasonable steps provide treatment time frame within treatment could reasonably provided 45 I satisfied Mr Perkins immediately act response concerns expressed Ms Ballard However absence evidence kind referred given I cannot exclude possibility told concerns turkey shortly arrival RSPCA officers I cannot satisfied time RSPCA intervention Mr Perkins failed take reasonable steps provide appropriate treatment 46 The charges relation turkey therefore also dismissed      __label__1

forensic pathologists approach sudden infant death classification However Professor Duflou maintained original opinion It put directly Cheyse death classified SIDS death San Diego criteria defective 19 Dr Sarah Parsons specialist forensic pathologist expertise children also provided report assistance Coroner Dr Parsons agreed Professor Duflou opinion Cheyse cause death specifically agreed evidence heroin methadone exposure well death half sibling meant SIDS available explanation Dr Parsons also agreed Cheyse exposure heroin caused death suggestive child risk Dr Parsons also analysed hair sample taken Cheyse post mortem examination There evidence exposure heroin She unable say Cheyse exposed heroin whether exposure maternal breast milk Dr Parsons noted Current literature advice breast feeding methadone benefits methadone maintenance treatment mother baby outweigh risks neonatal withdrawal syndrome u se illicit drugs heroin cause problems due fact exact composition drug known

post mortem persistence heroin breast milk Dr Gerostamoulos gave oral evidence hearing said test results Cheyse hair indicated exposed consumed heroin methadone either prior born birth form administration breastmilk exposed drugs environment child He said unlikely exposure could result around someone smoked heroin could ruled The likely explanation The actual consumption exposure drug mother either utero post birth case delivered breast milk Dr Gerostamoulos unable say whether Cheyse exposed substances via breast milk utero could combination He said evidence recent acute toxicity heroin drugs direct evidence heroin caused Cheyse death However noted written comment Dr Parsons report Children 2 years age capacity metabolise drugs extent adults therefore drugs may persist body longer periods time 21 Cheyse utero exposure heroin undoubtedly contributed developing neonatal abstinence syndrome However risk existed case due Ms Williams receiving methadone maintenance treatment pregnant breastfeeding Dr Williams evidence babies methadone likely suffer neonatal abstinence syndrome babies exposed heroin There evidence Cheyse exposed heroin time level likely produce fatal overdose response 22 Dr Parsons noted seizure leading Cheyse death possibly withdrawal could entirely excluded This observation made point time Ms Williams continued use heroin Cheyse birth known However evidence Professor Duflou seizure related death unlikely circumstances Cheyse history seizures Dr Carlisle Clinical Director Neonatalogy The Canberra Hospital noted seizure opioid withdrawal rare never seen one ten years practice The Canberra Hospital The evidence Ms King Dr Williams Cheyse history seizures Dr Carlisle also gave evidence withdrawal symptoms related chronic dependency rather acute exposure infant circumstances would unlikely seizure without symptoms If Cheyse suffered opioid withdrawal severity sufficient cause death 25 June 2017 highly improbable would displayed absolutely symptomology withdrawal prior death Opioid withdrawal rejected possible cause Cheyse death 23 There theoretical possibility Cheyse died result sleeping accident given evidence discovered blanket nose mouth However evidence Ms Williams put Cheyse bed morning 25 June 2017 blanket mouth evidence explicitly contrary The advice Ms King gave Ms Williams days earlier Cheyse longer needed

support KT I suggest make sense 2 At heart trial following key issue acts occur alleged KT LT BQ The accused denied acts occurred He outright denied On flipside three complainants individually independently asserting accused things end day I asking consider three lying making 3 36 After discussing tendency evidence inviting jury place KT evidence proper context prosecutor submitted jury find KT given accurate evidence appellant physical conduct towards The prosecutor submitted But evidence physically occurred consistent To end I suggest important recognise timeframe giving evidence Firstly I suggest would extremely hard lie something make something youth maintain lie face apparently believed take step going police go back police eight years later maintain lies actually happen And also purpose To allegedly redress wrong allowed go 14 years old 4 Secondly I suggest consider consistency core allegations KT asserted despite delay accounts Some peripheral facts may forgotten time That natural understandable But KT consistent core facts Further I suggest surprising KT describes events 2008 2017 may emphasised different aspects left details I suggest nature KT evidence accords normal behaviour You know said true core event change It lie 5 simply told slightly different way different emphasis Now also I ask consider KT conduct consistent somebody acting vindictively pursuing false vendetta Rather someone simply seeking redress past wrongs 6 For part KT conduct consistent somebody tried get life It make sense KT acts vindictively gets life lets years go without anything You also opportunity observe KT I suggest could see evidence time actions Such actions would speak reliving event She making 7 So I asking approach evidence KT collective wisdom common sense

essentially said Hey remember fabricated 8 How many times start conversations Hey remember speaking friends recalling past events I suggest KT making She something 38 The prosecutor made detailed submissions KT evidence concerning Counts 2 3 39 Next prosecutor dealt KT evidence supporting Counts 4 5 50 incident The accused says sexual activities bedroom never happened It apparently complete lie But plausible requires KT really memorised layout house previous occasion dropped BQ particular good knowledge recollection accused bedroom able properly construct scenario movement interaction people furniture 9 And use memory time later concoct sexual assault get money act going back partner tears complain sexual assault I suggest making It occurred There purpose outcome would achieve She going get money making motivation stitch accused KT waits months going police 10 Really If going stitch somebody wait Through I suggest logical reason cogent evidence KT make events 11 40 The prosecutor turned LT evidence The prosecutor pointed LT first disclosed alleged incident Counts 6 7 wife time separating feeling vulnerable The prosecutor continued It also important recognise LT speak siblings disclosing allegation This case LT concocting evidence conspiring siblings stitch stepfather 12 This case LT supporting KT This LT telling wife happened So told things telling actually happened I also suggest take confidence LT consider details types details expect somebody making stuff 13 For example specific clothing wearing football shorts Also LT able describe emotional manipulation situation spurred drink accused saying things like handle LT like waving red flag bull That level detail goes realm motivation possible manipulation It something making 14 I also ask consider description alcohol But LT making 15 told gifted Sambuca He trying exaggerate He took care say got small bottle But small bottle alcohol 13 year old boy mix It also suggested accused LT making support KT So apparently LT works mysterious ways Please recall LT essentially triggered events siblings going back police But LT spoke wife KT point time notion going police But apparently help KT support KT LT goes tells wife affairs time makes fake past abuse takes five days go tell sister apparently benefit 41 The prosecutor addressed evidence relating allegations concerning BQ First made following general submission I suggest would take great confidence BQ evidence She gave quite clear detailed evidence accused circumstances speak lying making things 16 I suggest forthright detailed describing took place The impression might BQ matter fact something live come terms 42 The prosecutor suggested gradual escalation appellant sexual behaviour towards BQ submitted See type details I suggest speaks events occurring Although I simplified short form complex narrative speaks accuracy truth She making 17 I also ask consider nature progression sexual acts suggest makes sense Now assessing BQ reliable credible witness please consider downplay participation If BQ hellbent trying stitch accused something I suggest make sense 18 BQ portray someone would willingly perform oral sex dad 43 After dealing evidence relating count concerning BQ prosecutor continued Now like LT BQ challenged respect making events support sister Please put context This sister little contact recent contact You heard phone call hung She want speak sister She supporting sister telling happened 44 The prosecutor moved evidence relating individual complainants referring tendency evidence expert medical evidence complaint evidence relating complainants I also request consider deliberations looking bigger picture KT LT BQ evidence concocted fabricated together This co ordinated effort lie stitch accused 19 Please note first disclosures They They people Sure enough ultimately talked would expect amongst siblings initial disclosures And talk heard really go depth detail graphic detail told police 46 The prosecutor submitted complainants described quite distinctive circumstances conduct occurred submitting clear distinctions inconsistent mixing memories He continued please consider family dynamics nature separate lives lived I suggest type relationship concoct support way If consider concoction I suggest really leaves one two possibilities KT LT BQ either individually lying unknown reason evidence alternatively individually telling truth 20 I suggest evidence squarely points conclusion truthful told accused 47 The prosecutor submitted jury reject appellant denials misconduct despite evidence good character 48 After dealing matters prosecutor concluded address follows Ladies gentlemen jury I leave one final thought When consider evidence I suggest accounts KT LT BQ way described occurred way individually disclosed accounts simply credible deny happened It credible assert three lying simply incredible think LT BQ making support KT 21 49 At conclusion prosecutor address defence counsel expressed concern prosecutor effect asked question Why would complainants lie Defence counsel submitted prosecutor reversed onus proof 50 Following brief discussion morning tea adjournment Thereafter defence counsel asked trial judge give jury direction commenced closing address defence Defence counsel sought sort rebuke nullify prosecutor underlying theme making 51 The prosecutor took issue suggestion closing address reversed onus proof 52 In response defence request prior closing address defence trial judge instructed jury customary remind onus proof always prosecution prove case beyond reasonable doubt 53 This full extent trial judge instruction 54 First defence counsel reminded jury onus standard proof appellant prove innocence prosecution prove case beyond reasonable doubt Later address defence counsel submitted whiff I say broad sense whiff appellant prove innocence Now Honour give direction due course onuses burdens proof One things say quite clearly simply matter believe It cannot ever simplified drilled basic proposition Because would suggest appellant believed way prove innocence No What always remember prosecution satisfied beyond reasonable doubt evidence led things occurred If think appellant says true might true I would also suggest would doubt prosecution case prove innocence If accept appellant would turn prosecution case decide whether still satisfied beyond reasonable doubt This suggested seeking redress wrong prosecutor said That role You fact finders You punish Now appellant prove conspiracy prove things I say leave doubt The burden placed upon prosecution satisfy beyond reasonable doubt It burden heavy one I suggest look evidence totality doubt throughout Again I emphasise ladies gentlemen appellant prove innocence It easy accusations like made I remind prove innocence But reality told things He say things alleged He simply tell 55 Relevantly trial judge directed jury follows As cases sexual misconduct alleged one prosecution witness position give direct evidence occurred particular event In case either KT LT BQ Unless satisfied respect count concerning individuals beyond reasonable doubt honest accurate account given cannot find accused guilty respect charges concerning individually Before convict accused examine evidence KT LT BQ carefully order satisfy safely act upon evidence high standard required criminal trial I remind accused position He says alleged acts simply happen He never sexually assaulted complainants never acted indecently He never committed alleged offences In criminal trial I emphasise emphasised number occasions Crown prove guilt accused The accused person prove anything Specifically accused person prove innocence An accused person prove reason motive witness saying whatever may said The accused presumed guilty charge unless prosecution proves guilt beyond reasonable doubt fact given evidence alter burden proof The accused prove version true The Crown satisfy account given accused accepted version events could reasonably true 56 After explaining proper approach drawing inferences expert evidence tendency evidence context evidence complaint evidence forensic disadvantage delay reporting alleged offences trial judge returned issue motive lie directed jury I remind accused come explanation complainants evidence may unreliable The burden prosecution prove case beyond reasonable doubt What comes back whether accept complainants evidence critical events beyond reasonable doubt You recall I told direct evidence respect charge comes individual complainant must look evidence complainant carefully But use complaint evidence assessment complainants evidence manner I discussed 57 The trial judge dealt alternative charges Counts 12 15 good character elements offences evidence relied upon establish charge giving final directions jury 58 At conclusion trial judge directions defence counsel sought redirection relation complaint evidence The trial judge acceded request 59 Defence counsel sought redirection relation motive lie onus proof 60 Unless context suggests otherwise ask Why would complainants lie invite jury reason motive lie positively established complainants evidence accepted Palmer v The Queen 1998 HCA 2 193 CLR 1 Palmer 7 Such reasoning would involve reversal onus proof requiring accused explain complainant may lied 61 In Palmer prosecutor cross examined accused inability identify complainant would lied At 9 majority said complainant account gains legitimate credibility absence evidence motive If credibility jury would otherwise attribute complainant account strengthened accused inability furnish evidence motive complainant lie standard proof extent diminished The correct view absence proof motive entirely neutral 62 In South v The Queen 2007 NSWCCA 117 South defence counsel proposed particular motive lie complainant In summing trial judge repeated question Why would lie prosecutor asked address At 42 43 Hunt AJA Simpson Whealy JJ agreeing said Where evidence complainant motive lie jury task consider evidence determine whether light evidence accept nevertheless satisfied evidence given complainant commission offence charged true The jury task necessarily include speculation whether reason would lie Nor jury task include acceptance complainant evidence unless positive answer question given accused To invite jury go beyond evidence supporting asserted motive accused relies evidence denying Crown relies ask Why would complainant lie suggest jury absence evidence beyond accused relies accept complainant evidence 63 Authorities dealing issue motive lie discussed Doe v The Queen 2008 NSWCCA 203 187 A Crim R 328 Doe At 58 60 Court articulated propositions distilled

particular motive lie The prosecutor submitted witness axe grind accused In summing trial judge repeated submission stating witness appear person axe grind Defence counsel objected The Court rejected proposition jury encouraged ask Why would witness lie 76 65 In Brown v The Queen 2008 NSWCCA 306 Crown addressed jury follows But ask two important questions situation somebody peril dying really thinking point going survive would nominate names person friend Why would nominate two people close friends knowing full well survive people actually shot would still loose community may well come back finish job Why would person 66 McClellan CJ CL Hall Harrison JJ agreed concluded submission reversed onus proof inviting jury accept witness evidence simply identified motive witness lie 50 The Court found submission understood contention good reason witness would lied e lie would exposed witness continuing physical danger 67 In MAJW v The Queen 2009 NSWCCA 255 MAJW appellant contended prosecutor address caused miscarriage justice invited jury speculate reasons complainant would lied At trial appellant denied sexual misconduct asserted complainant lying raised matters may provided motive lie In submission prosecutor asked jury Is reason complainant would want tell us lies The trial judge directly addressed issue motive lie directed jury trial competition complainant evidence accused evidence reminding issue whether prosecution proved case accused beyond reasonable doubt 68 As prosecutor submission MAJW Court observed would better prosecutor asked question 39 However question considered context introduced discussion alleged specific motives complainant lie question invitation speculate whether reason specific motives suggested complainant would lie suggested jury accept complainant evidence unless accused established particular reason might lie 32 The Court noted trial judge repeatedly directed jury presumption innocence onus proof specifically directed jury case involve competition complainant evidence accused evidence The Court also observed defence counsel sought redirection 44 69 In Popovic v The Queen 2016 NSWCCA 202 trial judge asked rhetorically witness would lie At 218 Adamson J Beazley P RA Hulme J agreed said The question motive lie tends arise two situations first witness respect evidence suggest motive lie secondly evidence reveals motive In first case jury ought asked consider witness would lie question tends suggest jury ought believe witness absence evidence suggesting motive lie However second case jury entitled asked consider validity motive lie asserted In case jury ought directed even reject motive lie put forward accused mean witness necessarily telling truth 70 The Court found effect trial judge rhetorical question suggest jurors could identify reason witness would lie accept evidence concluded error could give rise substantial miscarriage justice 71 In Hoyle v The Queen 2018 ACTCA 42 339 FLR 11 appellant convicted sexual offences number complainants students At trial suggested least students may motivated lie order avoid disciplined plagiarism assignments On appeal appellant invoked South arguing trial judge directions inadequate Honour directed jury even jury accept witness motivated lie reason suggested accused mean witness necessarily telling truth R v Jovanovic 1997 42 NSWLR 520 521 522 The trial judge directed jury following terms An accused person prove reason motive witness say whatever witness may said I accused come explanation complainants evidence may unreliable prosecution prove case It comes back whether accept complainants evidence critical evidence beyond reasonable doubt 72 The Court Appeal satisfied trial judge made clear jury onus appellant establish motive lie regardless whether motive lie raised core issue whether accepted critical aspects complainants evidence beyond reasonable doubt Consideration submissions case 73 The appellant submitted taken whole prosecutor closing address invited jury speculate whether complainants motive lie shifted onus proof prosecutor statements amounted assertion found complainant reason lie would conclude complainant told truth accused guilty 74 The appellant sought characterise case one direct evidence motive lie Alternatively appellant submitted Court found defence alleged particular motive lie prosecutor closing arguments gone far suggested absence credible motive lie evidence complainants accepted 75 Further appellant submitted trial judge failed neutralise prejudicial effect prosecutor address ensure jury understood onus never shifted prosecution The appellant submitted trial judge directed jury even rejected particular motives lie canvassed defence mean could satisfied complainants telling truth absence believable evidence motive neutral Did prosecutor invite wrong approach onus proof 76 In case credibility complainants critical issue In cross examination defence counsel put complainants lying making allegations sexual misconduct appellant 77 Specific motive lie raised appellant course trial As outlined 27 defence counsel put KT 1991 complaint made argument appellant inferentially form payback In relation Count 1 suggested KT spoken LT encouraged fabricate misrecall events In relation 2008 incident Counts 4 5 suggested KT felt vindictive towards appellant refused provide money More generally suggested complainants collaborated concoct evidence Defence counsel suggested BQ fabricated allegations sexual misconduct support sister KT gain attention Defence counsel put LT made allegations fellatio order support KT 78 Given way trial run unsurprising much prosecutor closing address centred jury believe complainant reject particular motives suggested defence 79 A contextual examination prosecution comments submissions appellant complained matters 1 21 35 48 discloses comments strongly worded appropriate Essentially issue jury whether critical aspects evidence complainant accepted beyond reasonable doubt The comments submissions question proposed reasons jury would reject motives lie asserted defence case suggested reasons jury would find complainants reliable witnesses 80 We consider substance subject comments submissions follows 2 Reasons jury would reject concoction motivated desire support KT b 3 A bare assertion complainants lying c 4 Reasons jury would reject motive KT lied 1991 complaint form payback following argument appellant 5 7 Reasons jury would accept KT reliable witness e 8 A reason jury would reject proposition KT influenced LT recall relation Count 1 f 9 Reasons jury would accept KT reliable witness relation Counts 4 5 g 10 11 Reasons jury would reject motive KT lied Counts 4 5 unhappy appellant refused give money h 12 An introduction submission reasons find LT reliable witness concocted allegations appellant purpose supporting KT 13 14 15 Reasons jury would find LT reliable witness j 16 17 18 Reasons jury would find BQ reliable witness k 19 A reason jury would find complainants jointly concocted evidence l 21 An orator flourish conclusion address contrasting credibility complainants incredibility defence case concocted evidence 81 None comments submissions invited jury speculate whether apart motives suggested defence may another motive complainant lie Nor submission suggest absence believable motive strengthened prosecution case let alone appellant bore onus establish least identify believable motive complainants lie 82 However comment 20 different category The prosecutor said If consider concoction I suggest really leaves one two possibilities KT LT BQ either individually lying unknown reason evidence alternatively individually telling truth 83 This submission suggested evidence believable motive lying jury must necessarily conclude complainants told truth As explained Palmer later cases absence believable motive lie entirely neutral support conclusion evidence complainant truthful If absence believable motive lie could used way evidentiary onus would shift accused 84 We divert refer briefly two difficulties prosecutor closing address 85 First prosecutor submitted rather motivated malice towards appellant assertion complainants motivated desire seek redress past wrongs comments 1 6 inappropriate As far ascertain transcript provided appeal evidence redress complainants motivation come forward The submission invited emotional response jury 86 Second prosecutor repeatedly referred rejected proposition complainants endeavouring stitch appellant In comment 18 prosecutor addressed proposition BQ hellbent trying stitch accused something These comments unnecessarily inflammatory 87 However appeal appellant argue prosecutor language emotional inflammatory cause contribute miscarriage justice Did trial judge fail correct invitation misapply onus proof 88 In view trial judge correct prosecutor invitation jury rely absence believable motive lie bolster complainants credibility thereby casting onus defence advance believable motive lie 89 Although direction trial judge gave conclusion prosecutor address clearly grapple issue raised submission 20 Honour dealt firmly matter final directions 90 The trial judge directions followed defence closing argument repeatedly emphasised correct onus standard proof 91 The trial judge directed jury way highlighted onus standard proof As stated relating onus standard proof issue motive lie Honour directed jury In criminal trial I emphasise emphasised number occasions Crown prove guilt accused The accused person prove anything Specifically accused person prove innocence An accused person prove reason motive witness saying whatever may said The accused presumed guilty charge unless prosecution proves guilt beyond reasonable doubt 92 Subsequently Honour returned theme onus accused advance believable motive complainants lie stating I remind accused come explanation complainants evidence may unreliable The burden prosecution prove case beyond reasonable doubt What comes back whether accept complainants evidence critical events beyond reasonable doubt 93 We conclude jury could left doubt correct approach motive lie evidence motive lie informed inform onus standard proof 94 At time trial defence counsel must view Although earlier sought correction error prosecutor submission clearly alive issue conclusion trial judge final directions sought direction motive lie related onus proof 95 Leave granted appeal ground context prosecutor submissions point trial judge directions relation motive lie onus proof inadequate      __label__1

tingling dysaesthesia light touch stimulation anterior lateral aspect left mid thigh extending distally knee distribution lateral cutaneous nerve thigh 53 In answering questions plaintiff solicitor Dr Brooder offered opinion plaintiff suffered traumatic injury left lateral femoral cutaneous nerve related heparin injection administered evening 12 August 2014 On information provided concluded injection administered superficial subcutaneous fat rather gone deeper subcutaneous fat region nerve haematoma formed 54 Dr Brooder considered manner injection performed described plaintiff caused residual neuropathy neuralgia saw continuing indefinitely Her prognosis guarded respect 55 The plaintiff sent review Dr Brooder approximately 12 months later She attended 8 May 2018 Dr Brooder provided reports Dr N Saines neurologist dated 14 January 2018 26 April 2018 Dr Saines qualified defendant He also provided copies photographs taken plaintiff thigh 20 August 2014 56 On occasion plaintiff reported condition remained essentially unchanged since previous consultation May 2017 Dr Brooder recorded plaintiff history sensory disturbance thigh aggravated increased physical activity Such activity prolonged standing would cause intermittent swelling However time said independent activities daily living personal care 57 On examination Dr Brooder found plaintiff without apparent disability gait mobility normal The neurological examination although occasion Dr Brooder found slight alteration sensation felt plaintiff coldness numbness extending proximally lateral aspect thigh 58 Upon reviewing photographs Dr Brooder noted injection site approximately 27 cm distal e leg anterior superior iliac spine 59 In relation first report Dr Saines commented follows I would agree comment Dr N Saines page 5 response The injection left lower lateral thigh may impinged lateral cutaneous nerve thigh On balance likely initiating cause symptoms I would also agree comment Dr N Saines page 5 response e The plaintiff describes symptoms consistent left Meralgia Paraesthetica On balance seems likely result thigh injection Dr N Saines page 5 response f also commented There extensive area sensory alteration hyperaesthesia outside anatomical distribution specific nerve This extends injection site well The reason extensive alteration readily explained anatomical basis I would suggest distribution plaintiff sensory disturbance defined photograph B dated 20 August 2014 conform distribution lateral cutaneous nerve thigh The distribution cutaneous sensory nerve quite variable The alteration sensation extends proximal injection site explained occurrence referred nerve symptoms 60 It apparent Dr Saines provided information caused alter opinion somewhat time second report This reflected Dr Brooder response new conclusion expressed Dr Saines I would disagree comment Dr N Saines page 1 paragraph 5 In essence likely cause plaintiff left meralgia paraesthetica compression lateral cutaneous nerve thigh common compression site inguinal region This site nerve involvement close surgical approach abdominoplasty also within cover compression garment worn post operatively The occurrence meralgia paraesthetica induced compression garment would consistent pressure neurapraxia potentially reversible nerve entrapment syndrome would expected improve spontaneously upon removal compression garment I would consider would unlikely compression bandage illustrated photograph A could responsible nerve damage proposed Dr Noel Saines report dated 26 April 2018 61 Dr Brooder remained opinion nerve damage suffered plaintiff consistent traumatic injury related either directly heparin injection associated haematoma 62 For purposes third report dated 16 December 2018 Dr Brooder provided report Dr R Lindeman haematologist qualified defendant emails defendant solicitor Dr Malhotra asking answer questions nerve conduction study He also asked comment contents Dr Saines reports 63 In relation Dr Malhotra Dr Brooder noted recording electrode placed 20 cm anterior superior iliac spine injection administered 27 cm point However commented The nerve conduction study undertaken Di R Malhotra 8 April 2015 almost eight months following injury plaintiff left lateral cutaneous nerve thigh From results nerve conduction study cannot concluded recording electrode placed site subcutaneous heparin injection abnormal nerve conduction result injection It well documented following nerve injury associated axonal degeneration occurs retrograde proximal direction well orthograde direction Wallerian degeneration As period almost eight months elapsed following injury left lateral cutaneous nerve thigh retrograde axon al degeneration nerve would extended proximally include recording electrode I would consider abnormalities defined nerve conduction study consistent injury left lateral cutaneous nerve thigh nerve conduction study findings certainly consistent

paraesthetica Bernhardt Roth syndrome clinical syndrome describes nerve entrapment syndrome involving lateral cutaneous nerve thigh inguinal region nerve emerges inguinal ligament Dr R Malhotra performed nerve conduction study undertaken history examination plaintiff able conclude abnormality involving left lateral cutaneous nerve thigh consistent clinical syndrome left meralgia paraesthetica It concluded results nerve conduction study abnormal nerve conduction involving left lateral cutaneous nerve thigh definitive clinical aetiology ascribed abnormal nerve conduction study findings 64 As reports Dr Saines Dr Brooder repeated comments made previous report addition alternative explanation proximal loss nerve function last sentence extract 59 That sentence read The alteration sensation extends proximal injection site readily explained occurrence referred nerve symptoms subsequent development proximal degeneration injured nerve 65 Dr Brooder went say It apparent additional comments Dr N Saines page 1 paragraph 4 based upon erroneous unsupportable clinical conclusion Dr R Malhotra based solely upon location recording electrode absence obtaining clinical history examination nerve conduction study results reported consistent clinical syndrome meralgia paraesthetica Dr N Saines failed consider possibility retrograde axonal degeneration occurring period almost eight months following nerve injury explanation abnormal nerve conduction study findings also extensive proximal distribution plaintiff sensory deficit documented clinical examination It would appear Dr N Saines subsequent change opinion concerning persistent painful sensory disturbance involving plaintiff left thigh based upon erroneous unsupportable clinical conclusion Dr R Malhotra nerve conduction study changes consistent clinical syndrome meralgia paraesthetica Apparently Defence asserted common cause meralgia paraesthetica included scar tissue near inguinal ligament due surgery I would disagree scar tissue near inguinal ligament common cause meralgia paraesthetica post surgical meralgia paraesthetica would somewhat uncommon The commonest cause meralgia paraesthetica entrapment syndrome lateral cutaneous nerve thigh region inguinal ligament commonly occurs overweight men compression nerve abdominal obesity use firm clothing particularly constrictive belt 66 Dr Brooder take issue views expressed Dr Lindeman report He concluded I would comment general particular relevance plaintiff clinical history It noted following evening subcutaneous injection heparin anterior lateral aspect left thigh increased local pain related injection site night become aware increasing soft tissue swelling anterior lateral aspect left thigh associated altered sensation lateral aspect left thigh Further assessed hospital resident medical officer following morning noted developed 3 x 3 cm fluctuant lump left mid thigh consistent haematoma associated altered sensation left thigh Once I would consider nerve damage sustained plaintiff consistent traumatic injury involving left lateral cutaneous nerve thigh lateral femoral cutaneous nerve mid thigh region related either directly subcutaneous heparin injection associated subcutaneous haematoma induced heparin injection 67 The plaintiff solicitors asked Dr Brooder clarify issues arising 16 December 2018 report The first related meant reference axonal degeneration Dr Brooder explained process follows injury peripheral nerve sufficient severity The axons within nerve degenerate die Importantly saw process could occur directions site injury site 68 He also asked explain thought open Dr Malhotra ascribe definitive clinical aetiology abnormal nerve conduction result He provided following explanation On 8 April 2015 Dr R Malhotra undertaken nerve conduction study plaintiff left lateral femoral cutaneous nerve thigh Undertaking nerve conduction study necessarily also involve obtaining clinical history undertaking clinical examination person When undertaking nerve conduction study Dr R Malhotra obtained clinical history undertaken clinical examination The nerve conduction study undertaken Dr R Malhotra 8 April 2015 demonstrated absence sensory action potential plaintiff left lateral femoral cutaneous nerve thigh consistent absence function left lateral femoral cutaneous nerve thigh Based solely result nerve conduction study undertaken Dr R Malhotra 8 April 2015 concluded plaintiff left lateral femoral cutaneous nerve thigh non functional However following nerve conduction study undertaken 8 April 2015and despite obtaining clinical history undertaking clinical examination Dt R Malhotra concluded neurophysiological evidence left Meralgia Paraesthetica Meralgia paraesthetica Bernhardt Roth syndrome clinical syndrome describes nerve entrapment syndrome involving lateral cutaneous nerve thigh inguinal region nerve emerges inguinal ligament To able conclude nerve conduction study clinical syndrome consistent Meralgia Paraesthetica would necessary obtain clinical history undertake clinical examination plaintiff In absence obtaining clinical history undertaking clinical examination based solely upon results nerve conduction study possible conclude specific clinical syndrome present Meralgia Paraesthetica definitive clinical aetiology ascribed abnormal nerve conduction findings 69 Dr Brooder asked identify literature supported hypothesis axonal degeneration He identified three papers These subsequently admitted evidence Exhibit D13 After referring papers Dr Brooder concluded Considering nature axonal degeneration following injury plaintiff left lateral cutaneous nerve thigh injury could certainly extend proximately distance 7 cm eight months 70 In relation two possible explanations symptoms suffered plaintiff time since second heparin injection Dr Brooder commented follows At time injection heparin anterior lateral aspect left thigh plaintiff developed increased local pain related injection site The increased local pain following injection consistent possibility traumatic injury left lateral cutaneous nerve thigh directly related subcutaneous heparin injection However night become aware increasing soft tissue swelling anterior lateral aspect left thigh associated altered sensation lateral aspect left thigh consistent local haematoma associated altered sensation left thigh potential injury left lateral cutaneous nerve thigh alternatively caused increasing haematoma It agreed opinion Dr R Lindeman report dated 19 June 2018 local soft tissue bruising common sequelae subcutaneous heparin injections haematoma formation recognised side effect injection An increasing haematoma could potentially result injury adjacent peripheral nerve However considering nature injury plaintiff left lateral cutaneous nerve thigh I would tend favour proposition injury directly related subcutaneous heparin injection rather alternative proposition injury related haematoma formation An injury inflicted directly nerve heparin injection likely result permanent nerve damage associated permanent neuropathy neuralgia injury related haematoma formation likely result potentially reversible neurapraxia 71 Dr Brooder final report dated 21 July 2019 responded two reports Dr Saines dated 16 January 2019 3 April 2019 report Dr Milovic dated 5 July 2019 In reports Dr Saines taken issue hypothesis symptoms injection site result nerve conduction study could explained process axonal degeneration affecting nerve proximal e injection site In relation symptoms Dr Brooder said Retrograde degeneration documented neuropathological process combined neuropathic changes peripheral nerve proximal sensory disturbance may occur 72 I understand retrograde degeneration refer process occurring site nerve injury 73 In relation nerve conduction results Dr Brooder disagreed Dr Saines elaborated following manner Undertaking neurophysiological study lateral femoral cutaneous nerve technically difficult procedure sensory action potential obtained low amplitude The presence retrograde degeneration nerve would result dispersion sensory action potential reduction amplitude sensory action potential rendering sensory action potential unobtainable 74 In relation Dr Saines report 3 April 2019 Dr Brooder agreed comments others He went say I would disagree comment Dr Saines page 2 paragraph 1 Dr Malhotra commented results nerve conduction studies consistent clinical findings Dr Malhotra undertaken clinical assessment plaintiff limited nerve conduction study undertaken It concluded Dr Malhotra nerve conduction study revealed abnormality peripheral nerve conduction involving lateral femoral cutaneous nerve clinical aetiology applied abnormal finding I would consider conclusion Dr Saines page 2 paragraph 1 balance probabilities likely disruption nerve complicated abdominoplasty post operative phase management Dr Saines consultant neurologist absence clarification experience surgical aspects abdominoplasty post operative management would appear comment beyond area expertise I would disagree comment Dr Saines page 2 paragraph 2 value study localisation lesion proximal site location thigh injection For reasons expressed concerning occurrence retrograde degeneration I would consider study unable definitively localise lesion involving plaintiff lateral femoral cutaneous nerve thigh 75 Dr Brooder asked specifically comment significance timing plaintiff left thigh symptoms relates issue causation After noting plaintiff suffered pain altered sensation second injection recounted history symptoms development haematoma injection He concluded I would consider timing onset plaintiff left leg symptoms paramount assessment likely cause condition Her condition consistent traumatic injury left lateral cutaneous nerve thigh lateral femoral cutaneous nerve resulted permanent nerve damage associated neuralgic pain syndrome Prior subcutaneous heparin injection subject sensory disturbance pain involving anterior lateral aspect left thigh At time injection increased pain related injection would consistent injection directly nerve Alternatively following heparin injection developed local haematoma could resulted nerve injury 76 In relation report Dr Milovic I initially indicated Dr Brooder comments would admitted evidence This stage outstanding objection tender Dr Milovic report Subsequently report admitted subject direction 136 Evidence Act 2011 ACT relation part history recorded report Having regard direction I gave I admitted second sentence first paragraph comments Dr Milovic report I however admitted rest comments Essentially Dr Brooder saw contents Dr Milovic report supporting conclusion plaintiff nerve injury probably caused heparin injection abdominoplasty procedure 77 Dr Brooder subjected searching cross examination Mr Walsh SC Dr Brooder confirmed time second consultation formed impression plaintiff independent personal care activities daily living although enquire detail latter He also marked diagram areas altered sensation impairment plaintiff left thigh 8 May 2018 became Exhibit D9 Dr Brooder asked counsel mark another diagram areas innervated lateral femoral cutaneous nerve femoral nerve intermediate cutaneous nerve Dr Brooder pointed considerable overlap variability He marked diagram became Exhibit D10 78 In relation proposition injection might given thigh muscle tissue Dr Brooder expressed view unlikely He thought probably given deeper layer subcutaneous fat region lateral cutaneous femoral nerve 79 It clear Dr Brooder found diagram contained Dr Malhotra notes p 14 Exhibit D8 hard reconcile tabulated results nerve conduction study He maintained position Dr Malhotra position make conclusion probable cause plaintiff nerve injury based results nerve conduction study alone 80 Mr Walsh SC put Dr Brooder number documents analysed published data concerning risks nerve damage complications associated abdominoplasty Exhibits D11 D12 These studies indicated 1 cases lead level permanent damage lateral femoral cutaneous nerve procedure Dr Brooder accepted proposition accurate The record made Dr Clink 18 August 2014 numbness groin put Dr Brooder absence recording found Dr Malhotra nerve conduction study report Mr Walsh SC asked whether either findings consistent meralgia paraesthetica Dr Brooder agreed Dr Clink finding consistent He think reasonable draw conclusion nerve conduction study 81 Dr Brooder questioned expertise nerve conduction studies He answered fact spent 20 time performing studies He also questioned area thigh innervated lateral femoral cutaneous nerve He agreed nerve innervate part posterior thigh He also agreed proposition needle used administer heparin struck nerve patient would expected feel sensation akin electric shock even taking strong pain killers The doctor replied would usually expect patient experience pain 82 Mr Walsh SC took Dr Brooder hospital clinical records detail highlighted absence record complaint pain Dr Brooder conceded basis information available content notes would reasonable conclude nerve injury probably caused haematoma penetration nerve needle 83 Dr Brooder questioned contents three articles formed part Exhibit D13 In particular tested conclusions expressed paper citation B G Cragg P K Thomas Changes conduction velocity fibre size proximal peripheral nerve lesions 1961 157 2 The Journal Psychology It put doctor insult nerves testing people showed full recovery conduction velocity

study performed 8 April 2015 84 In context said consider plaintiff suffered avulsion nerve Rather contended likely significant interference continuity nerve 85 As proposition equal likelihood cause nerve injury abdominoplasty Dr Brooder responded T 230 I1 24 Well time course happened As I obtained history following heparin injection pain mid thigh Following haematoma developed following sensory impairment nerve Now look time course whole problem know day zero operation day zero operation involved lower abdominal incision binder placed around abdomen Now time zero know nerve injured time surgery surgeon cut nerve immediate problem nerve Mrs Kempster would woken numbness distribution So occur So discount direct surgical assault injury Now application binder would compression effect would start time operation would delayed effect You discount scarring scarring takes months develop So assume yes perhaps binder would cause nerve compression result compression lateral cutaneous nerve thigh however Mrs Kempster remained initially asymptomatic 36 hours heparin injection heparin injection given point experienced pain haematoma sensory disturbance And mind time course injury follow line acute insult occurred time heparin injection related either directly indirectly heparin injection 86 Mr Walsh SC asked Dr Brooder contents hospital notes following exchange T 230 I25 34 Mr Walsh SC Of course would revisit theory accepted contemporaneous records made medical staff 12 13 August 2014 including Dr Saw complaint pain Dr Brooder Well pain may quite transient time injection Now injection given transient pain Sharp shooting pain like described nerve involvement pain could settle quite rapidly Plus also receiving told Tramadol Endone could dulled pain So I think lack pain necessarily mitigates time course events I described 87 In examination counsel plaintiff put evidence plaintiff felt injection given Dr Brooder T 232 l37 44 Mr Mcllwaine SC And said I instant pain It like bee sting I said ouch Now Doctor would consistent would expect person experience injury nerve Dr Brooder Well I understand I think I stung bee understanding bee sting sudden onset sharp severe brief pain sort sharp severe brief pain would consistent injury nerve yes 88 The plaintiff also relied evidence Dr Milovic given report dated 5 July 2019 In report expressed opinion abdominal compression garment prescribed plaintiff unlikely caused injury plaintiff nerve This opinion based never come across complication 25 years experience As whether injury caused surgery second heparin injection favoured latter due absence symptoms 31 5 hours surgery injection He thought pain time injection subsequent development haematoma sensory changes consistent injury caused injection 89 Dr Milovic cross examined He taken clinical notes file In particular taken note made Ms Matthews practice nurse note plaintiff attendance rooms dressing review 20 August 2014 He confirmed marked areas concern plaintiff left thigh taken photographs He also taken hospital clinical notes Apart orders doctor rounds record 13 August 2019 signed written record Dr Milovic clinical notes go interaction plaintiff morning 13 August 2014 In response proposition first knew allegation incorrectly given heparin injection received letter plaintiff solicitor dated 5 July 2019 Dr Milovic maintained knew time

SC The absence record Ms Matthews notes patient would reliable whether plaintiff made complaint 20 August 2014 Do agree 90 The plaintiff tendered report dated 13 April 2017 Ms K Sharp experienced registered nurse Objection taken paragraphs report either pressed ruled inadmissible The remainder report admitted part Exhibit P4 On assumption Mr Nunes administered heparin injection evening 12 August 2014 manner described plaintiff Ms Sharp expressed opinion manner injection given fell well acceptable standard reasonably competent nurse administering subcutaneous injection 91 The defendant relied upon evidence Dr N Saines This consisted five reports dated 14 January 2018 26 April 2018 16 January 2019 3 March 2019 23 July 2019 These reports together Dr Saines curriculum vitae admitted evidence part Exhibit D5 92 Dr Saines saw plaintiff consultation 10 January 2018 purposes first report He provided copies plaintiff Statement Claim excerpts clinical records hospital Jerrabomberra Medical Centre clinical notes Dr Milovic Dr Brooder report 3 June 2017 He also provided photographs taken plaintiff 20 August 2014 photographs syringes He also available Dr Malhotra nerve conduction study report diagram provided Dr Malhotra 93 Dr Saines took history plaintiff essentially consistent evidence On examination found area altered sensation hyperaesthesia extending beyond anatomical distribution lateral femoral cutaneous nerve 94 Based material available Dr Saines concluded injection may impinged lateral cutaneous nerve likely initiating cause symptoms 95 The defendant solicitor provided Dr Saines copies emails Dr Malhotra dated 29 January 2018 21 February 2018 20 August 2014 photograph previously provided photograph compression garment worn plaintiff patient guide issued Australian Society Plastic Surgeons Abdominoplasty Surgery latter admitted evidence Exhibit D3 96 Dr Saines responded material report 26 April 2018 He concluded information Dr Malhotra placed recording electrode injection site lesion nerve must occurred injection site He saw conclusion providing explanation extent plaintiff sensory deficit On basis concluded probable cause plaintiff condition compression lateral femoral cutaneous nerve inguinal region 97 In December 2018 defendant solicitors sent Dr Saines copy Dr Brooder reports dated 4 July 2018 16 December 2018 Dr Saines responded third report dated 16 January 2019 In report expressed opinion retrograde axonal degeneration significant process That supported clinical experience progressive ascending spreading sensory loss occur distal injury sensory nerve He maintained view damage lateral cutaneous nerve unlikely involve sensory loss medial aspect thigh He considered proximal extent sensory deficit simply referred symptomatology In view provided evidence proximal lesion nerve consistent compression inguinal ligament He noted compression neuropathies level always recover lack recovery designate nature site nerve lesion 98 On 22 March 2019 defendant solicitors wrote Dr Saines enclosing copy patient guide Exhibit D3 copies two articles relating complications arising abdominoplasty The latter articles admitted evidence Exhibits D11 D12 The letter sought doctor response series questions probable cause plaintiff nerve injury 99 In relation question relationship abdominoplasty damage lateral femoral cutaneous nerve Dr Saines concluded The nerve also close surgical approach abdominoplasty performed August 2014 within cover compression garment worn post operatively In considering contribution surgery nerve may directly damaged time local bruising swelling later scarring 100 With regard nerve conduction study result Dr Saines maintained view lack response testing nerve indicated damage within segment testing electrodes 101 He concluded combination extent sensory deficit found examination found Dr Clink 18 August 2018 results nerve conduction study supported hypothesis probable cause nerve damage abdominoplasty wearing compression garment post operation Dr Saines noted literature review articles provided indicated rate injury lateral femoral cutaneous nerve associated abdominoplasty surgery approximately 1 4 102 Finally 22 July 2019 defendant solicitors wrote Dr Saines enclosing copies Dr Milovic report 5 July 2019 supplementary report Dr Brooder dated 4 February 2019 together articles referred Dr Brooder Exhibit D13 Reference material cause Dr Saines alter opinion expressed previous report probable cause nerve lesion suffered plaintiff He disagreed Dr Brooder hypothesis sensory deficit injection site result nerve conduction study could explained axonal degeneration proximal injection site It noted however express agreement proposition permanent nerve damage consistent injury inflicted directly nerve injection compressive injury caused haematoma He saw latter likely cause reversible neuropraxis 103 Dr Saines gave evidence hearing 1 August 2019 In chief taken evidence Dr Brooder contents Cragg Thomas paper forming part Exhibit D13 He expressed view contrary Dr Brooder whatever damage done plaintiff nerve unlikely comparable severing avulsion occurred fourth category described paper He also disagreed analogy given Dr Brooder reduction nerve conduction velocity time case carpal tunnel syndrome While conceded may changes nerve conduction studies sensitive necessarily correlate clinical observations In practice seen case sensory loss increased time proximal injured sensory nerve loss sensation distal lesion 104 Dr Saines agreed articles referred Dr Brooder supported hypothesis retrograde axonal change However context studying animal nerves supported clinical experience 105 At hearing Mr Walsh SC asked Dr Saines opinion description given plaintiff needle causing pain like bee sting Dr Saines said T 291 I 10 17 Well always difficult interpret human beings description discomfort My bee sting I younger court interest hearing extremely painful persisted long time But people speak bee sting injection one flu shot I mean would say Oooh sting lasted period time I sure I necessarily correlate specific nerve quality 106 Under cross examination Mr McIlwaine SC following exchange occurred T 294 I20 33 295 I28 Mr Mcllwaine SC Well clinical opinion expressed report 14 January 2018 Mr Mcllwaine SC Was set page five report date paragraph named numbered paragraph Namely opinion injection left lower lateral thigh may impinged lateral cutaneous nerve thigh On balance likely initiating cause symptoms Dr Saines And I think anything wrong Mr Mcllwaine SC Well Dr Saines In sense initiating picture I subsequently came find examination So I think matter nuance Mr Mcllwaine SC Well let think moment Is opinion injection left lower lateral thigh may impinged lateral cutaneous nerve thigh Dr Saines May I accept Mr Mcllwaine SC And likely gone say needle impinges enters nerve Mr Mcllwaine SC It likely damage nerve Mr Mcllwaine SC And concluded balance seems likely result thigh injection say symptoms plaintiff Mrs Kempster experienced continues experience That correct Dr Saines Well I think report needs read completely And I think I go explain explain clinical presentation Mr Mcllwaine SC Well say balance seems likely result Dr Saines The initiating cause symptoms So let explain I sorry little confusing I said likely initiating cause symptoms Number e I said Yes could initiated things Number f I said I sorry I said really explain clinical presentation Mr Mcllwaine SC All right But let clear opinion wrote report Mr Mcllwaine SC And continues opinion today Mr Mcllwaine SC That needle impinging entering Mr Mcllwaine SC The nerve initiating cause Dr Saines I said may impinged lateral cutaneous nerve may initiating cause symptoms Mr Mcllwaine SC In words caused symptoms Dr Saines It may caused transient symptoms I say anything recovery I qualify clinical syndrome presented time examination inconsistent particular injury Mr Mcllwaine SC Well f refer complaint presented examination And explained say explains part complaints explained part lesion lateral cutaneous nerve thigh Mr Mcllwaine SC That say Mr Mcllwaine SC And continues opinion Dr Saines Along rest part f 107 Dr Saines asked questions studies described Exhibit D13 papers He challenge validity papers He however emphasise need careful applying clinical setting 108 Dr Malhotra called defendant He provided medico legal report objection taken plaintiff Dr Malhotra giving evidence beyond steps took perform nerve conduction study 8 April 2015 After hearing submissions parties I ruled defendant permitted ask doctor testing carried explain study report diagram provided showing study carried I ruled doctor asked opinion issues went beyond necessary deal matters 109 In examination chief doctor taken notice admit facts admitted evidence Exhibit D7 He confirmed accuracy 15 numbered paragraphs forming part notice 110 The doctor also taken bundle documents consisting clinical file copies communications defendant solicitor Exhibit D8 He explained detail procedure adopted performing nerve study He confirmed test left lateral femoral cutaneous nerve placed stimulating electrode inguinal ligament point anterior superior iliac spine recording electrode line point lateral part knee 20 cm leg He said diagram p 14 Exhibit D8 taken internet demonstrate general principle process The actual measurement points used accurately described photographs taken These photographs became Exhibit D18 111 He asked whether examined plaintiff He said took brief history looked 20 August 2014 photographs carry neurological examination thigh asked 112 Dr Malhotra explained tables report p 5 Exhibit D8 In particular said practice take 20 readings measurement sensory nerve The figures appear tables represent average readings 113 The doctor asked extent relied referral letter Dr Ahmed expressing view testing results provided evidence meralgia paraesthetica He responded follows T 420 I32 45 421 I8 Mr Walsh SC If I could take Dr Ahmed letter deal sentence sentence What relevance first sentence Jill IM injection August 12 Dr Malhotra Yes So loss sensation intramuscular injection nerve testing muscle cutaneous nerve So intramuscular injection I think piercing nerve different thing muscle relevance far Mr Walsh SC And relevance statement She got intense pain time Dr Malhotra Injection muscle cause pain If nerve injection piercing nerve cause pain Muscle muscle sensitive tissue Mr Walsh SC All right Now We treating conservatively improving She physio session back also result How relevant conclusion Mrs Kempster suffered meralgia paresthetica Dr Malhotra I think injection I took related finding case frankly speaking I think patient injection done area involvement nerve conduction study consistent findings So I made finding depending upon findings result nerve conduction study 114 Upon asked reasons consider abnormal nerve conduction result caused injection said T 423 I20 Dr Malhotra Because response injection given much lower anything would happen would happen beyond proximal All I written Dr Brooder opinion I agree different thing Anything happen injection happen beyond proximal opinion heparin injection caused problem 115 The defendant also relied upon report Dr Lindeman dated

Nunes dispute 130 The plaintiff makes specific submissions quantum damages claimed I address dealing issue 131 The defendant provided lengthy detailed written submissions The following paragraphs set I see key points made submissions 132 The defendant submits Court find second heparin injection given Mr Nunes accordance usual practice described evidence plaintiff husband The defendant argue plaintiff Mr Kempster dishonest testimony Rather said reference contemporaneous clinical records 2 September 2014 letter Exhibit D4 passage time fact spoken numerous occasions injection could concluded recollections event question unreliable In context Mr Walsh SC relied Coote v Kelly Northam v Kelly 2016 NSWSC1447 Coote 99 123 A finding terms would result judgment defendant 133 In relation harm suffered plaintiff result injection submitted Court find harm suffered haematoma described Dr Saw clinical note morning 13 August 2014 The defendant accepts plaintiff suffered damage left lateral femoral cutaneous nerve although says plaintiff claimed symptoms extend beyond distribution might expected damage The defendant argues likely cause damage nerve recognized 1 risk damage arising abdominoplasty procedure 134 As whether Mr Nunes breached duty care administering injection defendant notes apparent common ground Ms Sharp Mr Nunes injection given testified plaintiff husband demonstrated failure exercise reasonable care skill The defendant argues ultimately question breach duty turns upon whose evidence accepted plaintiff witnesses defendant witnesses 135 On assumption finding negligence defendant submits damages awarded basis two scenarios regard harm found caused negligence The first assumes finding negligence caused haematoma developed night second heparin injection circumstances nerve damage caused abdominoplasty contributed haematoma formation The second scenario assumes subject injection caused damage nerve addition haematoma The defendant makes detailed submissions consequences plaintiff reference scenarios I address discussion damages 136 The critical event case manner second heparin injection administered plaintiff around 20 00 pm 12 August 2014 137 The evidence given plaintiff whole process took 30 seconds Mr Nunes speak cannot correct regard clinical note made evening That note confirms conversation plaintiff Mr Nunes It also likely asked permission move bedcovers clothing access left thigh It would also accord natural probabilities Mr Nunes confirmed plaintiff give heparin injection allergic medication All inconsistent process completed within 30 seconds 138 However say inconsistencies indicate plaintiff recollection unreliable I found plaintiff straight forward witness best provide accurate account events She understandably focused degree harm believed suffered result injection however detract essential accuracy recollection It seems likely memory perhaps compressed medication shock received injection occurred 139 I also found Mr Kempster honest witness admitted aspects attendance Mr Nunes recall For instance T 137 138 remember Mr Nunes saying words effect I needle heparin injection He however recall nurse might confirmed plaintiff name date birth whether allergies Although later denied occurred I understood denial basis simply could remember happening 140 Mr Kempster recall manner injection given shaken cross examination point He also remembered plaintiff complaint time injection 141 The development haematoma altered sensation across plaintiff thigh second heparin injection context suffered adverse symptoms receiving first heparin injection leaves little doubt Mr Nunes something performing simple subcutaneous injection night 12 August 2019 It important note plaintiff husband complained way injection given Dr Milovic morning 13 August 2014 20 August 2014 It true Dr Milovic physically note complaints I accept evidence recalls complaints Kempsters upset caused outcome injection immediate post operative period It also apparent reference GP notes injection IM plaintiff perception injection harder deeper Having regard fact plaintiff referred injection cause thigh problems complaint letter dated 2 September 2014 Exhibit D4 natural probabilities strongly favour likelihood plaintiff husband would complained injection Dr Milovic 13 20 August 2014 142 It also important note contents fifth paragraph complaint letter That contemporaneous record way plaintiff husband saw injection administered It refers failure pinch skin injection given straight thigh Mr Kempster comment vigorous nature injection I see statements providing strong corroboration account plaintiff Mr Kempster injection given I also find reference sharp stinging burning sensation supports assertion plaintiff felt pain akin bee sting immediate aftermath injection I consider force proposition use word letter suggests pain delayed significant time injection Indeed seems context consistent plaintiff felt pain time injection short period afterwards It also important note plaintiff says letter pay stinging burning sensation much attention next morning She thought due effect strong pain killers taking 143 Against evidence defendant relies evidence Mr Nunes invariable practice There discussion weight given evidence Neville v Lam No 3 2014 NSWSC 607 Neville Beech Jones J said 103 Fourth Mr Bartley SC submitted little weight given much Associate Professor Lam evidence stated would said Ms Neville turn derived described invariable practice dealing patients He referred following passage judgment Basten JA Elayoubi v Zipser 2008 NSWCA 335 86 Elayoubi Evidence usual practice may assistance circumstances mechanical steps routine tasks issue witness supposedly undertook task particular occasion recollection occasion The weight given evidence depend upon possibility likelihood departure practice However present case concerned mechanical step routine task concerned quite

delivery 105 Neither party addressed whether evidence usual invariable practice tendered prove said particular occasion caught tendency rule 97 Evidence Act 1995 Leaving aside number difficulties reliance upon usual practice cases involving medical professional advice prevalent case 106 One difficulty assertions hard scrutinise It difficult envisage means plaintiff Ms Neville position could

Neville However Mr Nunes complete lack recollection specific injection evening 12 August 2014 means assert believes would done reference usual invariable practice I note I difficulty notion invariable practice Ordinary human experience suggests always momentary lapses careless errors performance mundane routine tasks That said Mr Nunes impressed earnest hardworking nurse However I doubt busy workload see T 312 l3 8 I infer probably time pressure complete tasks end shift 22 00 145 I satisfied Mr Nunes administer injection manner fell standard care expected nurse position Whether due pressure work momentary carelessness inserted needle angle allowed point penetrate deeper tissues overlying plaintiff left thigh muscle I find probably attempt pinch skin plaintiff thigh make attempt effectively The injection cause immediate sharp pain plaintiff made exclamation effect husband testified 146 It likely sharp pain last long neither plaintiff husband said anything specifically Mr Nunes cause make note time In evidence chief Mr Nunes suggested would made note heard plaintiff say ouch I accept would done There undoubtedly range responses patient injection It simply possible make blanket assessments busy nurse might react full range responses The probability Mr Nunes either notice comment see plaintiff reaction significant enough warrant inquiry notation 147 In relation absence detail manner injection given pain plaintiff felt time contained GP notes Dr Milovic letter complaint dated 2 September 2014 I find explained nature records case Both GP notes Dr Milovic kept basic medical records forensic detailed account generally required legal case see Container Terminals 8 Mr Walsh SC submitted Court prefer acceptance clinical notes considered unreliability plaintiff evidence relying upon decision Simoes v Kel Campbell Pty Ltd 2018 NSWCA 284 Simoes proposition I opinion case turns much facts In Simoes record GP note idea accident happened taken account trial judge

applicable inconsistencies gaps 150 In relation Exhibit D4 clear plaintiff husband drafted complaint letter include considered important time The grapefruit reference undoubtedly reflected plaintiff subjective perception time There suggestion evidence considering legal action stage If would reasonable expect far detailed recitation occurred I see inconsistencies clinical notes letter extent cause doubt essential reliability account plaintiff husband administration injection Mr Nunes 151 Having found liability defendant vicariously liable Mr Nunes breach duty care necessary ascertain nature extent harm caused negligence 152 Section 45 Civil Law Wrongs Act 2002 ACT relevantly provides 1 A decision negligence caused particular harm comprises following elements 153 It difficult ascertain precisely occurred nerve time injection However I say I found evidence Dr Brooder reports oral testimony impressive helpful He dealt extensive cross examination Mr Walsh SC careful responsive manner making concessions appropriate explaining position number issues clarity Dr Brooder ultimately concluded probable cause injury lateral femoral cutaneous nerve direct insult nerve caused heparin injection I accept Dr Brooder conclusion analysis It accords complete absence symptoms post operative period prior second heparin injection explains continuity symptoms suffered plaintiff ever since injection 154 While true extent plaintiff complaints times greater might expected injury lateral femoral cutaneous nerve core complaints tested Dr Brooder examination essentially consistent diagnosis 155 I accept plaintiff complaint pain back thigh cannot due damage done lateral cutaneous nerve However far I see references symptoms back leg descriptions given plaintiff T 21 l20 evidence chief T 111 12 cross examination I cannot find reference complaint medical reports clinical notes The statements plaintiff evidence little confusing I taken descriptions general area experienced symptoms reference product hypersensitivity lateral part thigh fit within area innervated lateral femoral cutaneous nerve At rate I see complaints significant causation analysis 156 The significant issue arises respect plaintiff symptoms extending site injection It certainly appears initially least plaintiff suffered numbness upper thigh near groin That recorded GP clinical notes photographs taken Dr Milovic consultation 20 August 2014 2 September 2014 complaint letter According plaintiff evidence area abnormal sensation decreased time see T 111 l33 Certainly examined Dr Brooder first time 31 May 2017 area abnormal sensation described confined anterior lateral mid thigh extending area knee Dr Brooder saw within distribution lateral femoral cutaneous nerve He described region symptoms examined plaintiff 8 May 2018 although occasion also noted cold sensation slight numbness extending proximally lateral aspect thigh 157 Dr Saines expressed view relation findings examination 10 January 2018 extent abnormal sensation greater would expect damage done lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injection site In particular noted area altered sensation site 158 Dr Brooder commented finding report 9 July 2018 He noted high degree individual variability cutaneous sensory nerves He thought symptoms injection site could explained referred nerve symptoms Subsequently dealing contention nerve conduction study indicated lesion injection site Dr Brooder proffered opinion likely explanation process axonal degeneration injury caused injection 159 Dr Milovic supported Dr Brooder analysis conclusion I treated Dr Milovic opinion appropriate level caution given alternative view causation would result finding potentially reflected treatment plaintiff Dr Milovic acknowledged proud history performing abdominoplasty operations many years complications involving damage lateral femoral cutaneous nerve 160 While Drs Saines Malhotra took issue Dr Brooder opinion I consider logical explanation sequence events befell plaintiff second heparin injection The evidence Dr Saines first report cross examination supports proposition plaintiff nerve injury least initiated injection While maintained view extent symptoms result nerve conduction study supported hypothesis either damage done time surgery consequence surgery scarring swelling perhaps wearing compression garment must contributed injury I see difficulties accepting explanation plaintiff symptoms Firstly would expected nerve damaged surgery plaintiff would suffered symptoms immediately recovered effects anaesthetic She Secondly nerve compressed scarring would expected process would take months operation see Dr Brooder T 193 l1 5 T 230 l15 Thirdly nerve compressed swelling elastic garment explanation would involve remarkable coincidence symptoms commenced immediate aftermath incorrectly given injection While possible I find probable cause extensive symptoms suffered plaintiff particularly post operative period start nerve injury suffered time injection accordance opinion Dr Brooder 161 It follows conclusion I reject hypothesis advanced Drs Saines Malhotra nerve conduction study establishes plaintiff must suffered nerve lesion stimulation recording points tests carried Dr Malhotra 8 April 2015 I referred difficulties I accepting Dr Saines view cause plaintiff nerve injury As Dr Malhotra view must acknowledged performed single diagnostic test plaintiff At time carry full neurological examination assessment condition based upon full history taken plaintiff In context I prefer explanation given Dr Brooder I find abnormal nerve conduction study result caused process described Dr Brooder secondary injury done nerve time second heparin injection 162 It follows analysis I satisfied symptoms suffered plaintiff left thigh material times caused negligence defendant responsible 163 Having accepted plaintiff honest essentially reliable witness I also accept consequences nerve injury described summarised paragraph 50 I propose award general damages basis There appears real issue neurological evidence plaintiff symptoms related impairments likely permanent given period suffered present It submitted behalf plaintiff appropriate award general damages 110 000 For defendant submitted second scenario accords findings award 85 000 164 Having regard nature injury suffered plaintiff effects injury I assess general damages 95 000 The plaintiff life expectancy 29 years I see reason depart usual approach awarding interest one half general damages referable past On basis I award interest 2 5 years 47 500 This results interest award 4 750 Out pocket expenses past future 165 The parties agreed I found favour plaintiff issue liability causation amount incurred plaintiff past treatment 3 477 10 I award amount The plaintiff claims interest rate 3 5 years That figure approximates one half rate adopted r 1619 Court Procedures Rules 2006 ACT basis expenses paid consistent basis past 5 years That seems reasonable basis award interest I award interest sum claimed 521 56 166 The plaintiff claimed sum 5 000 future treatment needs notional buffer noting modest continuing medication usage treatment needs The defendant submitted award made head The plaintiff evidence relation current treatment indicated fairly minimal She said taking one packet Nurofen month cost 6 8 Although Dr Brooder referred possibility pain management treatment seems though plaintiff yet discuss possible treatment option doctors She started seeing GP Adelaide however evidence provided frequency cost consultations relation thigh 167 It seems possibility plaintiff might seek pain management treatment basis Dr Brooder estimation first report would cost 500 I much doubt plaintiff undergo surgical treatment nerve another possibility referred Dr Brooder Doing best I scant evidence I award plaintiff 2 000 respect future treatment expenses 168 The plaintiff submitted total 66 614 awarded damages past loss earning capacity Of 1 900 said incurred consequence plaintiff take extra two week work due nerve injury 12 August 2014 56 914 said represent difference average net weekly salary Mint 2014 5 967 compared actual earnings basis 569 May 2016 resigned Mint February 2019 moved Queensland back Adelaide From February 2019 plaintiff claimed 7 800 representing assumed loss 300 per week net 26 weeks 169 The defendant hand argued nothing beyond 1 900 awarded either past future This put basis plaintiff loss job Mint caused decision move Queensland injury It also argued various medical conditions mitigated working carer cook I say I accept argument relation Queensland move It entirely reasonable plaintiff follow husband Queensland posted RAAF The defendant also submitted plaintiff would unlikely take heavier physical work due non injury related pre existing medical conditions I also accept plaintiff suffered relevant disability medical conditions would sufficient prevent working carer cook Queensland Finally defendant argued reason plaintiff suffering reduction earnings present choice work less full hours 170 There number difficulties damages claimed plaintiff head Firstly I note report forensic accountant amount included loss prior July 2016 He refers paragraph 6 2 report Exhibit P5 p 105 plaintiff used accrued leave cover time operation I infer sick leave Having regard resignation seem extra time required consequence nerve injury resulted actual financial loss 171 Secondly claim advanced plaintiff assumes plaintiff would able continue working Queensland earning level Mint The plaintiff conceded cross examination Mint position much one kind The plaintiff prospects obtaining position around Ipswich providing income equivalent receiving Mint 2014 15 2015 16 seems rather remote Thirdly I persuaded argument injury plaintiff would made earnings equivalent would earning Mint working carer commercial cook In relation former I note plaintiff worked position period 1994 1995 Thereafter although remained continuous employment apart years catering Woomera worked exclusively office administrative positions Moreover unlike position put plaintiff respect carer employment opportunities see T 33 l30 33 evidence availability commercial cooking positions around Ipswich 172 As consequence I accept possible assess damages past loss earning capacity basis initially pressed plaintiff In oral submissions Mr McIlwaine SC plaintiff argued circumstances award nature buffer appropriate I agree submission 173 I accept plaintiff good work history would probably obtained full time work around Ipswich injured Given difficulties finding full time office work I find injury plaintiff would addition work Department Education Queensland worked 15 20 hours per week carer time job ATO became available April 2018 Once job became available likely view plaintiff would undertaken second casual job rather physically arduous duties associated carer 174 The plaintiff since Mr Kempster retirement return Adelaide continued work 20 hours per week ATO She could wanted working 25 hours per week However chosen work extra day I persuaded would looking extra work carer cook since February 2019 suffered nerve injury Thus I accept suffered reduction earning capacity I persuaded period resulted financial loss plaintiff 175 At p 119 Exhibit P5 forensic accountant sets calculation difference net income 2016 17 plaintiff actual earnings would earned assuming gross income 55 000 year The figure 55 000 represents I understand estimated full time earnings carer based figures extracted p 111 exhibit Allowing tax accountant arrives loss figure financial year 13 699 That figure provides reasonable guidance view actual financial loss suffered plaintiff year For 2017 18 equivalent calculation results loss figure 19 706 The total loss thus calculated 33 405 Having regard findings paragraph 173 best I variables necessarily arising accountant assumptions calculations I assess plaintiff damages past loss earning capacity 30 000 The plaintiff written submissions claims interest rate 3 3 25 years That seems reasonable basis calculation I award interest 2 925 176 The plaintiff claims buffer 100 000 future loss earning capacity damages This based upon notional loss 300 per week 7 years discounted 3 The evidence disclose clear terms plaintiff currently earning job ATO Her payslip June 2018 see Exhibit P5 p 156 discloses earning 33 per hour time Assuming rate still applicable plaintiff would earning 660 gross per week 20 hours work 825 chose work 25 hours per week At current tax rates equates 601 719 net per week respectively 177 My assessment plaintiff enjoying engagement young grandchild There

Australia relationship refugees reported heavily media These reports usually concern Australia treatment refugees arriving shores In interesting turn events however attention directed towards Steven Utah Australian citizen sought asylum Canada Recent revelations concerning September 2017 decision Canada Immigration Refugee Board IRB grant refugee status Utah sparked public discussion Australia witness protection programs Utah claimed refugee status due threats life arose direct result status informant Australian Crime Commission Utah provided information ACC investigation outlaw bikie gangs The ACC outed Utah media release 2006 murder contracts placed life The decision Canada IRB believed first internationally grant refugee status Australian described ANU Matthew Zagor unprecedented The decision raises questions efficacy witness protection programs Australia The IRB stated Australian authorities failed offer Utah adequate protection unclear whether formal witness protection part broader pattern corruption ineptitude structural difficulties Corruption historically significant Australian policing issue one could point Fitzgerald Inquiry involved wide ranging investigation police corruption Queensland resulted imprisonment four ministers Ineptitude difficult measure politically contentious topic assessing structural difficulties would involve large scale consideration witness protection programs across Australia It worth noting problems highlighted IRB arise least part fact Australia lacks cohesive approach witness protection Given division policing powers federal state agencies surprising structural difficulties witness protection arise At federal level witness protection governed Witness Protection Act 1994 The Australian Federal Police Commissioner sole responsibility deciding whether place witness National Witness Protection Program In reaching decision Commissioner must regard seven criteria listed section 8 3 Witness Protection Act These criteria focus criminal history witness witness suitability placed program nature offence witness relevance evidence witness give availability alternative viable methods protection perceived danger witness nature witness relationships witnesses witness protection program The use word must section 8 3 confers obligation Commissioner consider criteria reaching decision The Commissioner therefore although discretion making final decision discretion whether consider criteria However unlike administrative processes unclear whether failure consider criteria section 8 3 reviewable creating structural issue akin referred IRB The Australian Federal Police 2011 2012 Witness Protection Annual Report states decisions made relation National Witness Protection Program subject review Administrative Decisions Judicial Review Act 1997 meaning determinations subject judicial review Review decisions carried differently jurisdictions example Tasmania decision Police Commissioner may reviewed ombudsman NSW Commissioner decision reviewed Law Enforcement Conduct Commission The Report state alternative avenues review administrative review available A possible rationale lack review would necessity secrecy witness protection programs However lack review processes could point potential structural deficiency National Witness Protection Program At state level witness protection programs mirror National Witness Protection Programs distinguishing features For example New South Wales Victoria South Australia Western Australia Northern Territory contain provisions equivalent section 8 3 witness protection legislation However ACT specify decision made must accordance section 8 Queensland offers comprehensive assessment criteria borrowing Federal Act offers expanding include information provided relevant body Tasmania leaves decisions sole discretion Police Commissioner Queensland Witness Protection Program nation wild card It governed independent commission chairperson opposed Police Commissioner Chief Police helm Thus Queensland witness protection scheme functions differently majority programs Australia serving example inconsistencies witness protection programs exacerbated federal system These structural differences Australia various witness protection programs run may structural difficulties outlined IRB decision Yet point lack cohesion programs represent key protective strategy witnesses whose evidence extremely valuable law enforcement bodies This lack cohesion results potentially vulnerable witness protection system witnesses threat Steven Utah left vulnerable Fear insufficient protection upon providing evidence may also leave potential witnesses reticent comes assisting law enforcement When occurs system fails The fact refugee status granted Steven Utah suggests reform Australia witness protection systems needed Such reform could involve increasing cohesion various state federal approaches uniform legislation establishing independent statutory body regulate practice approach witness protection programs introducing better review procedures decisions pertaining witness protection Although apparent reforms would effective clear quite

Question 1 Are particular flowers like photographing Yes My favourite obvious choice tulips Firstly heart warming After long Winter months Canberra colourful tulips herald promise warmer weather sunshine things outdoors Secondly beautiful photograph definitely star show With 100 species tulips planted Floriade array shapes colours endless And lastly sculptural Long stems bulbous petals standing proudly lush leafed bases make interesting compositions singular flowers groupings mass What love flower Question 2 What best time day capture photos I see mostly landscape photographer I usually shoot sunrise sunset capture spectacular skies beautiful landscapes play long light accentuate parts scene However attending Floriade many times last year I came realise take good flower photos time day Many different photographic effects achieved depending weather time day amount ambient light Some effects fun try Close ups translucent petals framing colourful stamen This achieved photographing backlit flowers sun still fairly low morning 11ish Close ups sun rays flaring edges petals leaves This achieved shooting backlit flowers moving camera slightly allow sun peak around edges creating sun rays flares This done time day Brightly coloured blooms vivid blues skies best achieved cloudless days mid morning mid afternoon shooting flowers upwards Colourful blooms cocooned textured foliage This achieved shooting blooms foliage without sky background This works particularly well cloudy days tones textures foliage blown strong sunlight Another opportunity great flower photos NightFest 6 30 10 30pm Floriade second week The everchanging lights illuminating garden beds makes beautiful close ups long distance shots The garden beds truly come life night photographed compositions park features including Ferris Wheel roving entertainers stages The cacophony light colour spectacular Question 3 What strategies taking close flowers The ideal situation getting sharp flower close ups using tripod set flower height However often difficult dangerous lots people paths around garden beds For close ups I lie alongside garden beds holding camera propped elbows keep steady This way I causing accidents people falling trod Fortunately many garden beds raised kneel shoot bed comfortable height Question 4 Do prefer taking photos whole scene close ups As landscape photographer I usually like shooting big picture The drama long swathes colour certainly hero shot Floriade However I come appreciate micro landscapes within flower beds equally riveting The drama pops colour deep dark foliage textures tones variegated colour combinations make amazing compositions Delicate pollen coated stamens cocooned translucent petals frilly petals fury stems unopened buds straining sun make exquisite macro photography Floriade grand event To capture big small see entirety Question 5 What must photo opportunities Floriade Shooting beautiful compositions play leading lines sweeping garden beds paths anchored ponds Ferris Wheel Shooting unique rare beautiful flowers close range different stages maturity several weeks different lighting conditions groupings backgrounds The top Ferris Wheel beautiful views stunning planting schemes difficult capture ground level Narang Pool many vantage points easily discovered walking around Photos flowerbeds foreground across pool look fabulous Also shooting across pool flower beds distance make beautiful garden sky reflections Unfortunately hard shoot night time worth effort Night photography requires understanding camera settings tripod Long exposures stable camera capture kaleidoscope lights colours cleverly orchestrated create visual feast Dogs Day Out time favourite Floriade event shoot Thousands wagging tails smiling owners create friendliest event I ever attended With everyone best behaviour happy photo taken eager share dog stories enjoying day photo opportunities priceless The best shots dog height flowerbeds background Lots people pooches fancy dress pleased photo taken Shooting dog level upwards owner make fun interesting shots The NOT obvious must photo opportunities SO worth Photos enjoying beautiful flowers To get shot go This event good miss It bring joy get outside make walk give happy memories Take photos Photos children They cutest things around flowers smiling day And lastly dog take Dogs Day Out They love Question 6 How take photos looking sun Shooting sun subject foreground really creative way capturing photos Shooting sun produces lens flare instead damaging photos use spectacular results Shooting sun usually creates silhouettes subject Silhouettes caused camera trying expose whole photo rather subject Seeing common see lot sun sky photos likely get silhouette To avoid silhouettes change metering mode Spot Spot metering means camera expose whatever centre shot rather whole photo This likely lead blown overexposed backgrounds But part effect shooting sun The best times day get great lens flare early morning later day At times lie ground get sun behind subjects The sun also seems softness moves horizon Question 7 What three tips every budding photographer abide For lighting biggest consideration shooting You plan getting particular shot anticipating certain lighting conditions often lighting hoped Being able adapt shooting maximise ambient lighting conditions way avoiding coming home empty handed Many times I abandon plan go flow grabbed shot better one I Try take photos tell stories pictures say thousand words A photo creates emotional response stand audience Planning secret success Decide advance story want tell tell get As skills improve often fly Being able look lens see great composition manipulate camera settings optimise lighting instinctively know going edit crop image later ultimate photography skill Practice practice practice Decide skill want improve go practice ages Taking photos randomly much improve skills If love sunrise sunset shots go times day find best shoot You discover quite boring without something foreground give context make interesting Practicing photography skills makes automatic grab great shots fly rapidly changing conditions Once achieved competent skill set never want put camera Follow Carol take things Canberra carolelvin      __label__1
