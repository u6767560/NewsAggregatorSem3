# Welcome to NewsAggregator Sem3
## Project Introduction:


The current media is in crisis.The traditional media which provided valuable news to the people is being slowly wiped out and the new media is dazzling, which is driven by sponsored posts, hype,clicks and ads.
In the recent years most of the media hubs have adapted to subscription models which made it harder for the news to reach everyone.

In order to achieve a balance between the two and push valuable news for the audience, we are building a News Aggregator
using dozens of traditional sources and thousands of primary sources including parliaments,think tanks,policy groups,parties and non-profits
using various machine learning models to aggregate based on importance and Location.

## Project Objective
